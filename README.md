# Predictive Pricing Optimization Model for Ride-Sharing Services

A machine learning–driven system that predicts optimal ride fares using real-time supply-demand conditions, time-based factors, and customer segmentation—enabling data-driven dynamic pricing strategies for ride-sharing platforms.

---

## Project Overview

This project develops a **Predictive Pricing Optimization Model** that dynamically estimates the most suitable ride fare based on operational and contextual variables such as driver availability, demand intensity, trip duration, and customer loyalty.  
The goal is to **maximize platform revenue**, **improve driver utilization**, and **enhance market responsiveness** through intelligent, data-backed pricing decisions.

## Problem Statement / Objective

Ride-sharing companies often rely on heuristic or rule-based surge pricing models that fail to adapt efficiently to complex market conditions.  
The objective of this project is to design and evaluate a **machine learning model** that can accurately **predict ride costs** by learning from historical patterns—enabling **automated, optimized pricing** that balances demand, supply, and profitability.

## Technology Stack & Tools

The project is implemented in **Python**, utilizing the following key libraries and tools:

| Category | Tool / Library | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Handling** | Pandas, NumPy | Data loading, cleaning, and numerical computation |
| **Visualization** | Plotly | Interactive visualization and model performance analysis |
| **Modeling** | Scikit-learn | Implementation of Linear Regression and evaluation metrics |
| **Preprocessing** | MinMaxScaler, ColumnTransformer, OneHotEncoder | Feature scaling and encoding of categorical variables |

## Methodology

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**  
   - Imported the `dynamic_pricing.csv` dataset.  
   - Performed exploratory data analysis and descriptive statistics to identify data distributions, missing values, and correlations.

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Applied logarithmic transformation (`np.log1p`) on **Historical_Cost_of_Ride** and **Expected_Ride_Duration** to mitigate skewness and stabilize variance.  
   - Derived and encoded categorical variables (e.g., `Location_Category`, `Vehicle_Type`).

3. **Preprocessing Pipeline**  
   - **Categorical Features**: Transformed using **OneHotEncoder**.  
   - **Numerical Features**: Scaled using **MinMaxScaler**.  
   - Combined transformations using **ColumnTransformer** for efficient preprocessing.

4. **Model Training**  
   - Trained a **Linear Regression** model to predict log-transformed ride costs.  
   - Split the dataset into training and testing subsets to evaluate model generalization.

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Measured performance using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R-squared (R²)**.  
   - Visualized actual vs. predicted ride costs using Plotly scatter plots for model validation.

## Results & Key Insights

The **Linear Regression model** demonstrated strong predictive performance:

- **R-squared (R²)**: ≈ **0.97**  
  → Indicates the model explains ~97% of variance in ride cost predictions, showing a high degree of fit.  

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: ≈ **1.81**  
  → Reflects minimal error on the log-transformed cost variable.  

- **Visualization Insight**:  
  The actual vs. predicted cost scatter plot shows predictions tightly clustered along the ideal line, validating model accuracy and reliability for deployment in real-time pricing scenarios.

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates how **machine learning can be leveraged to optimize ride fares dynamically**.  
By integrating real-time variables such as demand-supply ratio, time of booking, and customer segmentation, the model provides a foundation for **intelligent, adaptive pricing engines** in ride-sharing ecosystems.  

Future work could extend this project by incorporating:
- Real-time data ingestion pipelines (e.g., Kafka, Spark).  
- Non-linear models (e.g., Gradient Boosting, XGBoost) for improved accuracy.  
- Integration with REST APIs for live deployment in ride-hailing platforms.
